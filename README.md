# Welcome to AF4H World o' code!

OK, so it's a small world. Is it truly a world? Anyway....

This repository is intended to share (and maybe collaborate?) on various software items used in the Hamshack operations of AF4H. Starting with the basics:

 1) **MESHPBX**: A FreePBX instance dedicated to the AREDN MeshPhone network. These files are files added that aren't normally part of a MeshPhone PBX.

 2) **MMDVM  Modifications**: Modifications I make to the MMDVM system I use in my Hamshack. Initially is a small script I threw together to quickly show the status of the 2 functions I use - DMR and POCSAG (DAPNET), with the intention to source this file in developing my web site.

 3) **QSL Label Printing**: scripts, templates, etc that I use to process outgoing paper QSL cards. These are primarily driven via the QRZ.com logbook and APIs and use gLabels to generate PDFs for printing.

 4) **QSL Indexing**: Scripts used to scan, index, and display printed QSL cards received.
